The UX design of the mouse has been one of the most solidified. The steel series keeps the same **learnability** that knows and loves from a mouse but adds a bit more features to it.
It has natural **mapping**, I put my right hand on the mouse and know the first clicker I use my index finger with, and the button on the right I use my left finger with. 

The scroll wheel is also a natural feeling as up makes a page go up and down makes a page go down. The **learnability** of a mouse has always been this but the steel series has added two new buttons on the left side of the mouse and has made the scroll wheel a bit more responsive. This mouse compared to other mice feels more **efficient** in terms of having more options than a regular mouse but not overdoing it with buttons and ruining the nice **mapping** a normal mouse has. The scroll wheel feels like it hits hard stops but retains a type of smoothness to it. When playing video games I can rely on the mouse to stop on an item I'm trying to use without over or undershooting the scroll wheel. 

This is a big help when playing video games and makes me a more effective player in games. the same can be said about the two buttons on the right side of the mouse, I can choose not to have any function for the two buttons or have my own custom mapping to these buttons for a better gaming **experience**. Overall I like the Steel Series Mouse as it retains the simplicity of a mouse and adds a few new and easy-to-use functions without sacrificing the **learnability** and **efficiency** of a regular non-RGB mouse.

Going into this jounral entry I was making a pretty good protien shake for after my workout but I never realized how simple my blender is. All you do is putwhatever ytou want twist on the blade cap then put it in the actual plender part then BOOM you got yourself a smoothie, protien shalke, etc.


I like to point out how stealr the learnalilityand memorability this product has. When you actually use it you donty need to go through many settings because it only has one setting...blending. You set up the blender the way it needs to be then jsut twist and blend it's something that anyone can do and rememebr. The satification from this machine is amazing because it is simple and does exactly what it needs too which also make it an effiecnet machine for you blending needs. 

The error tolance, hwoever, is not so good because sometimes I run into this issuse of screwing the lid on wawkawrdly and it can make a mess and potentialy have a saftey issuse depending on the situatuon. 

Although this product has a little down side it is a satfactory prodeuct that makes my potien shakes without having to go through many setting to get what i wasnt. It has proved it's usefulness to me and feel as if my user exprience with it has been nothing but good.

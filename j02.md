Going into this journal entry I was making a pretty good protein shake for after my workout but I never realized how simple my blender is. All you do is put whatever you want twist on the blade cap then put it in the actual blender part then BOOM you got yourself a smoothie, protein shake, etc.


I like to point out how good the **learnability** and **memorability** this product has. When you use it you don't need to go through many settings because it only has one setting...blending. You set up the blender the way it needs to be then just twist and blend it's something that anyone can do and remember. The **satisfaction** from this machine is amazing because it is simple and does exactly what it needs to which also makes it an **efficient** machine for your blending needs. 

The **error tolerance**, however, is not so good because sometimes I run into this issue of screwing the lid on awkwardly and it can make a mess and potentially have a **safety** issue depending on the situation. 

Although this product has a little downside it is a **satisfactory** product that makes my protein shakes without having to go through many settings to get what I want. It has proved its **usefulness** to me and feels as if my user experience with it has been nothing but good.

The UX design of the wheel in a tesla model 3 is slick and effective. Although the driving is different the learnability is quite quick. It is a fast accelerating vehicle with a 
minimalist design. The mapping of the wheel is perfect. It has simple functions with a normal turn signal on the left that has a button that turns on the windshield wipers
It also has two buttons that have deeper functions. The one on the left can play music and control the sound which makes it more efficient when comes to changing music or 
controlling the sounds. The one on the right can control cruise control so you can customize your driving experience. You can potentially make your driving experience more safer or
useful. On the right is the stick that controls driving. Up for reverse, down for drive, button on the stick for the park. It is a super simple design with a good amount of useful
functionality. The idea of the wheel was to make something effective, efficient, and memorable. It has achieved this and has made a satisfying driving experience.

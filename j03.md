minimalist design. The mappping of the wheel is perfect. It has simple functions with a normal turn signal on the left that has a button that turns on the windshieild wipers
It also has two buttons on which has deeper functions. The one on the left can play muisc and contoll the sound whcih makes it more effiecent when comes to changing music or 
contolling the sounds. The one on the right can controlll cursie contorl so you can comtumize your driving expeice. You can potential make your drivng expeence more safer or
